Social Determinants of Health:
Life Events
Structured Variable Definitions


Description: The following lists structured variables used in defining 9 different life events covered in our NLP analysis. These definitions cover structured variables from inpatient/outpatient ICD diagnosis codes, VA service StopCodes, and Health Factor Surveys. The 9 life events were selected as being relevant to measuring suicide risk by Dr. Tamang et. al. To our current knowledge, there is not a publication that defines these 9 life events directly, but we have been able to find other studies that contain structured data definitions for some of these life event categories.  Purpose: Having a well-defined set of structured variables will ensure confidence in measurements made with NLP methods, and help demonstrate how feature extraction improves the detection of life events when compared to features clinicians already have access to. Our study aims at comparing how well documents are flagged as containing life events between two approaches: 1) linking documents from structured variables along VisitSID and 3) searching over document text for life event mentions. We believe that the our work will show that domain specific lexicons can improve the retrieval rate of documents containing life events. 

To our knowledge, we’ve constructed these life event definitions as close as possible to social determinant of health definitions in previous VA literature that use structured variables[1]. Some codes were composed from our exploration of the VA data and require validation by a domain expert. Throughout this document, we indicate whether codes were referenced from a previous study or if they were added by our group. There are also questions we’ve had w.r.t. to specific life events.

Food Insecurity {FOOD_INSECURE} – This domain includes terms related to food insecurity, a risk factor within the REACH VET predictive model for identifying veterans at a statistically elevated risk for suicide and other adverse outcomes. Food Insecurity is part of the Economic Stability Determinant Area within the “place-based” organizing framework of the Healthy People 2020 Approach to Social Determinants of Health. Terms in this domain are focused on assessment and diagnosis. They were initially identified via SIREN’s Compendium of medical terminology codes for social risk factors (https://sirenetwork.ucsf.edu/tools-resources/resources/compendium-medical-terminology-codes-social-risk-factors) and further expanded through transitive closures and synonymy within UMLS Metathesaurus and SNOMED CT in particular. Annotations with any of these terms when pertaining to the patient are likely to indicate the presence of this risk factor.

Blosnich et. al. have definitions of housing instability, job instability, legal issues, and military sexual trauma. Their study was limited to patient data in 2016 so ICD9 codes were disregarded, but they also include health factor data. Though social connection like categories were not part of their study, they did include many of the codes we use for social connection in exposure to violence and social/familial problems.

Opioid specific cessation study. Found that risk for suicide increases immediately after starting or stopping treatment with opiods. Substance use in this study was measured and the definition of substance use excluded nicotine. Cessation was measured according to when prescription codes terminated a treatment on opioids.

The VHA two-item MST screener was used. This screener asks veterans "While you were in the military … a) Did you receive uninvited and unwanted sexual attention, such as touching, cornering, pressure for sexual favors, or verbal remarks?; b) Did someone ever use force or threat of force to have sexual contact with you against your will?". Endorsement of either a, b, or both is acknowledged to denote a positive MST screen. The screener as described in the paper was not found along Health Factor tables, but MST positive flags were found.
